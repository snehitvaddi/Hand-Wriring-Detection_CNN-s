# Hand-Writing-Detection_CNN-s

* In this project/Repo I do recognition of Hand written numbers using CNN's( Convolutoin Nural Networks ).

Data set is taken from Keras Dataset Library named as MNIST library. The data set consists of 60000 images with 28X28 pixel size. Note : Data set comes with predefined Features and Labels.
This project helps to understand implementation of basic CNN concepts for image analysis and other pattern recognition algorithms.
